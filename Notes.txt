* commented every BT* code that had a BLE* counterpart
* iocap had to be changed to ble:
    esp_ble_io_cap_t iocap = ESP_IO_CAP_IO;
* compiled, but had linker errors:
    enabled bluetooth 4.2 features in menuconfig
* pairing works only with ble 4.x Keyboard (Logitech MX-Keys), but not with Keychron K1 Pro, 
  which should be Bluetooth (LE?) 5.1, but seems to be only recognized viausb keyboard BT-classic..
